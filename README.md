# Microstates React TodoMVC Example

This project shows what using Microstates with React might look like. This is a very early example.
We'll likely create a connect function that will make this integration less verbose.

Microstate is in [src/contains/Apps.js](src/contains/Apps.js#L19)

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to
view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br> You will also see any lint errors in the console.
